## Installation

1. **Install Python** (version 3.8 or higher)

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** - Streamlit will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## Data Persistence

The app uses Streamlit's session state for data persistence during the session. Data is stored in:
